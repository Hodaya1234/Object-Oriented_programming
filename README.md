# Object-Oriented_programming
Assignments from the OOP course. The main project was creating a cool graphic Arakanoid game.
ex4 - Evaluating mathematical expressions. A recursive program that introduced us to the basic concepts of OOP, like interfaces and inheritance.
ex6 - The finished Arakanoid game. Has a very nice GUI that can be configured by writing a text file. The program reads the configuratio text file and creates levels to play.
ex7 - Space Invaders game, using the same framework we built for the arakanoid game. This was an example of code reusing in different projects.
Fun course!
